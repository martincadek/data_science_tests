# Task 1

A colleague has finished a survey (data file attached) to measure the satisfaction on buying our Pay Monthly product. He is reporting an overall satisfaction of 4.5 out of 5. What questions or concerns would you have at this point to assess whether the results are reliable and representative?

# Task 2

You are tasked with assessing the feedback from customers using the main website while buying a Pay Monthly contract. The survey to collect this feedback would be designed by you. The business requirements include measuring the customer's satisfaction with the digital flow, perception of content understandability and propensity to buy again. How would you design this survey and which data points would you use for your analysis?

Please note you do not have to create the actual survey, just indicate the general structure and how the analysis would be performed on the results.
